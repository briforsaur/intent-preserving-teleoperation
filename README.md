The files in this project are the result of work on my PhD research.
I unfortunately do not have time to provide a detailed documentation of this code and how to use it.
On the most basic level, most of the interaction with the code can be done through the script run_model.m.
That script will select a model based on the parameters you set within the script to run a simulation of my Intent Preserving Teleoperation approach through Simulink.

The code here was used to produce the results for the paper:

Forbrigger, S., & Hashtrudi-Zaad, K. (2021). An Intent-Preserving Approach to Telerobotic Rehabilitation. Proc. of the IEEE World Haptics Conference (WHC), 739â€“744. https://doi.org/10.1109/WHC49131.2021.9517196
